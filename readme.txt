DetMatrix will solve matrixes for you of any size.
It takes advantage of multiple CPUs.

I think this app is pretty selfexplanatory.
You can do with this program whatever you wish. It´s freeware.
You can give it away, decompile it, sell it and so on.

The only problem that will arise is the EXTRA unit. You have to place it
in a convenient place for you and then change the project´s settings.
